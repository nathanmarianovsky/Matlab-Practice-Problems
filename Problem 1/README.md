<h1 align="center">Problem 1</h1>

#Statement
Write a function that takes the following input:

- MIN (integer)
- MAX (integer)

and returns a random number between MIN and MAX. Then write a script that takes input from the user and calls the function to get the output. In the end you should have two files:

- First one to hold just the function
- Second one that asks for the input and returns an output for a user

Make sure that you document the code well enough to make it easy to understand to any person. Note that if function files are in the same directory as the script, then the functions can be called without having to be imported.

#Goals
The point of this problem is to practice:
- Writing a function
- Understading the rand function
- Getting input from a user
- Returning output to user
