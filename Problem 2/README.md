<h1 align="center">Problem 2</h1>

#Statement
Write a function that takes the following input:

- SIZE (integer)
- MIN (integer)
- MAX (integer)

and use the function from Problem 1 to have this function generate an array of random numbers each between MIN and MAX. The number of elements contained in the returned vector should be equivalent to SIZE. To finish write a script that takes the input from the user and calls on this function to get the vector of random numbers. In the end you should have three files:

- First one to hold the function from Problem 1 (You can avoid this by just importing it instead from the other folder)
- Second one to hold the function that generates the array
- Third one that asks for the input and returns an output for a user

Make sure that you document the code well enough to make it easy to understand to any person. Note that if function files are in the same directory as the script, then the functions can be called without having to be imported.

#Goals
The point of this problem is to practice:
- Writing a function that calls on another function (Nesting Functions)
- Understading arrays
- Getting input from a user
- Returning output to user
