<h1 align="center">Problem 2</h1>

#Statement
Write a function that takes the following input:

- SIZE (integer)
- MIN (integer)
- MAX (integer)

and use the function from Problem 1 to have this function generate an array of random numbers each between MIN and MAX. The number of elements contained in the returned vector should be equivalent to SIZE. To finish write a script that takes the input from the user and calls on this function to get the vector of random numbers. 

#Goals
The point of this problem is to practice:
- Writing a function that calls on another function (Nesting Functions)
- Understading arrays
- Getting input from a user
- Returning output to user
